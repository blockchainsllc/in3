The **Incubed** client is a

- Crypto-Economic
- Non-syncronizing and stateless, but fully verifying
- Minimal resource consuming

blockchain client (Crypto-Economic Client, Minimal Verification Client, Ultra Light Client). This version is written in C.

Most blockchains, such as Ethereum, require a client to connect to their blockchain network. Often, these clients
require a lot of storage, a very high bandwidth or constant computation. While this is possible to perform on laptops or desktop systems,
mobile devices, mobile app, and even web applications struggle to meet these requirements. Currently the solution of choice is to use a
light client or remote client on mobile devices. While this may work for mobile phones, most IoT devices are unable to run light clients.
Connecting an IoT device to a remote node enables even low-performance IoT devices to be connected to blockchain. However, by using distinct
remote nodes, the advantages of a decentralized network are undermined introducing a single point of failure. Also, it is unsecure because
the client is not able to verify the results by itself. The same applies for mobile apps or web pages.
The Trustless Incentivized Remote Node Network, in short **Incubed**, makes it possible to establish a
decentralized and secure network of remote nodes and clients which are able to verify and validate the results, enabling trustworthy and
fast access to blockchain for a large number of low-performance IoT, mobile devices, and web applications.

## Example

Please have a look at the examples folder in the repo for more detailed [examples](https://github.com/blockchainsllc/in3/tree/master/examples).

### CLI

in3 can be used on the command line in this manner:

`in3 [options] method [arguments]`

For example,

To get block number, run:

```
> in3 eth_blockNumber
8610795
```

A more detailed list with information on arguments can be found [here](https://in3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-cmd.html).

### C Code

Example C code can be found [here](https://github.com/blockchainsllc/in3/tree/master/examples/c)

```c
#include <in3/client.h>    // the core client
#include <in3/eth_basic.h> // use the basic module
#include <in3/in3_curl.h>  // transport implementation
#include <inttypes.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
 // register a chain-verifier for basic Ethereum-Support, which is enough to verify blocks
 in3_register_eth_basic();

 in3_register_curl(); // use curl as the default for sending out requests

 in3_t* in3 = in3_for_chain(CHAIN_ID_MAINNET); // create new incubed client

 char *result, *error;  // prepare 2 pointers for the result.

 in3_ret_t res = in3_client_rpc(   // send raw rpc-request, which is then verified
     in3,                    //  the configured client
     "eth_getBlockByNumber", // the rpc-method you want to call.
     "[\"latest\",true]",    // the arguments as json-string
     &result,                // the reference to a pointer whill hold the result
     &error);                // the pointer which may hold a error message

 if (res == IN3_OK) {
   printf("Latest block : \n%s\n", result);
   free(result);
 } else {
   printf("Error verifing the Latest block : \n%s\n", error);
   free(error);
 }
 in3_free(in3);   // cleanup client after usage

}
```
