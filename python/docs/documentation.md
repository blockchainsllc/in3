# API Reference Python

## Python Incubed client

This library is based on the [C version of Incubed](http://github.com/slockit/in3-c), which limits the compatibility for Cython, so please contribute by compiling it to your own platform and sending us a pull-request!

Go to our [readthedocs](https://in3.readthedocs.io/) page for more.

### Quickstart

#### Install with pip 
 
```shell script
pip install in3
```

#### In3 Client API

```python
import in3

in3_client = in3.Client()
# Sends a request to the Incubed Network, that in turn will collect proofs from the Ethereum client, 
# attest and sign the response, then send back to the client, that will verify signatures and proofs. 
block_number = in3_client.eth.block_number()
print(block_number) # Mainnet's block number

in3_client  # incubed network api 
in3_client.eth  # ethereum api
in3_client.account  # ethereum account api
in3_client.contract  # ethereum smart-contract api
```

#### Developing & Tests
Install dev dependencies, IDEs should automatically recognize interpreter if done like this.
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Compile local libraries and run tests. Make sure you have cmake installed.
```bash
./buidl_libs.sh
```

### Running the examples

To run an example, you need to install in3 first:
```sh
pip install in3
```
This will install the library system-wide. Please consider using `virtualenv` or `pipenv` for a project-wide install.

Then copy one of the examples and paste into a file, i.e. `example.py`:

`MacOS`
```sh
pbpaste > example.py
```

Execute the example with python:
```
python example.py
```

## Incubed Modules


### Client
```python
Client(self,
chain: str = 'mainnet',
in3_config: ClientConfig = None,
cache_enabled: bool = True,
transport=<function https_transport at 0x101898e60>)
```

Incubed network client. Connect to the blockchain via a list of bootnodes, then gets the latest list of nodes in
the network and ask a certain number of the to sign the block header of given list, putting their deposit at stake.
Once with the latest list at hand, the client can request any other on-chain information using the same scheme.

**Arguments**:

- `chain` _str_ - Ethereum chain to connect to. Defaults to mainnet. Options: 'mainnet', 'kovan', 'goerli', 'ewc'.
- `in3_config` _ClientConfig or str_ - (optional) Configuration for the client. If not provided, default is loaded.
- `cache_enabled` _bool_ - False will disable local storage caching.
- `transport` _function_ - Transport function for custom request routing. Defaults to https.
  

#### refresh_node_list
```python
Client.refresh_node_list()
```

Gets the list of Incubed nodes registered in the selected chain registry contract.

**Returns**:

- `node_list` _NodeList_ - List of registered in3 nodes and metadata.
  

#### config
```python
Client.config()
```

Client configuration dictionary.

**Returns**:

- `config` _dict_ - Client configuration keys and values.
  

#### ens_namehash
```python
Client.ens_namehash(domain_name: str)
```

Name format based on [EIP-137](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-137.md#name-syntax)

**Arguments**:

### ClientConfig
```python
ClientConfig(self,
chain_finality_threshold: int = None,
account_secret: str = None,
latest_block_stall: int = None,
node_signatures: int = None,
node_signature_consensus: int = None,
node_min_deposit: int = None,
node_list_auto_update: bool = None,
node_limit: int = None,
request_timeout: int = None,
request_retries: int = None,
response_proof_level: str = None,
response_includes_code: bool = None,
response_keep_proof: bool = None,
transport_binary_format: bool = None,
transport_ignore_tls: bool = None,
cached_blocks: int = None,
cached_code_bytes: int = None,
boot_weights: bool = None,
in3_registry: dict = None)
```

Determines the behavior of the in3 client, which chain to connect to and how to manage information security policies.

Considering integrity is guaranteed and confidentiality is not available on public blockchains, these settings will provide a balance between availability, and financial stake in case of repudiation.

The newer the block is, higher are the chances it gets repudiated by a fork in the chain. In3 nodes will decide individually to sign on repudiable information, reducing the availability. If the application needs the very latest block, consider using a calculated value in `node_signature_consensus` and set `node_signatures` to zero. This setting is as secure as a light-client.

The older the block gets, the highest is its availability because of the close-to-zero repudiation risk, but blocks older than circa one year are stored in Archive Nodes, expensive computers, so, despite of the low risk, there are not many nodes available with such information, and they must search for the requested block in its database, lowering the availability as well. If the application needs access to _old_ blocks, consider setting `request_timeout` and `request_retries` to accomodate the time the archive nodes take to fetch the inforamtion.

The verification policy enforces an extra step of security, adding a financial stake in case of repudiation or false/broken proof. For high security application, consider setting a calculated value in `node_min_deposit` and request as much signatures as necessary in `node_signatures`. Setting `chain_finality_threshold` high will guarantee non-repudiability.

**All args are Optional. Defaults connect to Ethereum main network with regular security levels.**

**Arguments**:

- `chain_finality_threshold` _int_ - Behavior depends on the chain consensus algorithm: POA - percent of signers needed in order reach finality (% of the validators) i.e.: 60 %. POW - mined blocks on top of the requested, i.e. 8 blocks. Defaults are defined in enum.Chain.
- `latest_block_stall` _int_ - Distance considered safe, consensus wise, from the very latest block. Higher values exponentially increases state finality, and therefore data security, as well guaranteeded responses from in3 nodes. example: 10 - will ask for the state from (latestBlock-10).
- `account_secret` _str_ - Account SK to sign all in3 requests. (Experimental use `set_account_sk`) example: 0x387a8233c96e1fc0ad5e284353276177af2186e7afa85296f106336e376669f7
- `node_signatures` _int_ - Node signatures attesting the response to your request. Will send a separate request for each. example: 3 nodes will have to sign the response.
- `node_signature_consensus` _int_ - Useful when node_signatures <= 1. The client will check for consensus in responses. example: 10 - will ask for 10 different nodes and compare results looking for a consensus in the responses.
- `node_min_deposit` _int_ - Only nodes owning at least this amount will be chosen to sign responses to your requests. i.e. 1000000000000000000 Wei
- `node_list_auto_update` _bool_ - If true the nodelist will be automatically updated. False may compromise data security.
- `node_limit` _int_ - Limit nodes stored in the client. example: 150 nodes
- `request_timeout` _int_ - Milliseconds before a request times out. example: 100000 ms
- `request_retries` _int_ - Maximum times the client will retry to contact a certain node. example: 10 retries
- `response_proof_level` _str_ - 'none'|'standard'|'full' Full gets the whole block Patricia-Merkle-Tree, Standard only verifies the specific tree branch concerning the request, None only verifies the root hashes, like a light-client does.
- `response_includes_code` _bool_ - If true, every request with the address field will include the data, if existent, that is stored in that wallet/smart-contract. If false, only the code digest is included.
- `response_keep_proof` _bool_ - If true, proof data will be kept in every rpc response. False will remove this data after using it to verify the responses. Useful for debugging and manually verifying the proofs.
- `transport_binary_format` - If true, the client will communicate with the server using a binary payload instead of json.
- `transport_ignore_tls` - The client usually verify https tls certificates. To communicate over insecure http, turn this on.
- `cached_blocks` _int_ - Maximum blocks kept in memory. example: 100 last requested blocks
- `cached_code_bytes` _int_ - Maximum number of bytes used to cache EVM code in memory. example: 100000 bytes
- `boot_weights` _bool_ - if true, the first request (updating the nodelist) will also fetch the current health status and use it for blacklisting unhealthy nodes. This is used only if no nodelist is availabkle from cache.
- `in3_registry` _dict_ - In3 Registry Smart Contract configuration data

gather the receipt, once a miner has mined and it is part of an acknowledged block. Because how it is possible,
in distributed systems, that data is asymmetric in different parts of the system, the transaction is only "final"
once a certain number of blocks was mined after it, and still it can be possible that the transaction is discarded
after some time. But, in general terms, it is accepted that after 6 to 8 blocks from latest, that it is very
likely that the transaction will stay in the chain.
