class ClientConfig(DataTransferObject):
    """
    Determines the behavior of the in3 client, which chain to connect to and how to manage information security policies.

    Considering integrity is guaranteed and confidentiality is not available on public blockchains, these settings will provide a balance between availability, and financial stake in case of repudiation.

    The newer the block is, higher are the chances it gets repudiated by a fork in the chain. In3 nodes will decide individually to sign on repudiable information, reducing the availability. If the application needs the very latest block, consider using a calculated value in `node_signature_consensus` and set `node_signatures` to zero. This setting is as secure as a light-client.

    The older the block gets, the highest is its availability because of the close-to-zero repudiation risk, but blocks older than circa one year are stored in Archive Nodes, expensive computers, so, despite of the low risk, there are not many nodes available with such information, and they must search for the requested block in its database, lowering the availability as well. If the application needs access to _old_ blocks, consider setting `request_timeout` and `request_retries` to accomodate the time the archive nodes take to fetch the inforamtion.

    The verification policy enforces an extra step of security, adding a financial stake in case of repudiation or false/broken proof. For high security application, consider setting a calculated value in `node_min_deposit` and request as much signatures as necessary in `node_signatures`. Setting `chain_finality_threshold` high will guarantee non-repudiability.

    **All args are Optional. Defaults connect to Ethereum main network with regular security levels.**

    Args:
        chain_finality_threshold (int):  Behavior depends on the chain consensus algorithm: POA - percent of signers needed in order reach finality (% of the validators) i.e.: 60 %. POW - mined blocks on top of the requested, i.e. 8 blocks. Defaults are defined in enum.Chain.
        latest_block_stall (int): Distance considered safe, consensus wise, from the very latest block. Higher values exponentially increases state finality, and therefore data security, as well guaranteeded responses from in3 nodes. example: 10 - will ask for the state from (latestBlock-10).
        account_secret (str): Account SK to sign all in3 requests. (Experimental use `set_account_sk`) example: 0x387a8233c96e1fc0ad5e284353276177af2186e7afa85296f106336e376669f7
        node_signatures (int): Node signatures attesting the response to your request. Will send a separate request for each. example: 3 nodes will have to sign the response.
        node_signature_consensus (int): Useful when node_signatures <= 1. The client will check for consensus in responses. example: 10 - will ask for 10 different nodes and compare results looking for a consensus in the responses.
        node_min_deposit (int): Only nodes owning at least this amount will be chosen to sign responses to your requests. i.e. 1000000000000000000 Wei
        node_list_auto_update (bool): If true the nodelist will be automatically updated. False may compromise data security.
        node_limit (int): Limit nodes stored in the client. example: 150 nodes
        request_timeout (int): Milliseconds before a request times out. example: 100000 ms
        request_retries (int): Maximum times the client will retry to contact a certain node. example: 10 retries
        response_proof_level (str): 'none'|'standard'|'full' Full gets the whole block Patricia-Merkle-Tree, Standard only verifies the specific tree branch concerning the request, None only verifies the root hashes, like a light-client does.
        response_includes_code (bool): If true, every request with the address field will include the data, if existent, that is stored in that wallet/smart-contract. If false, only the code digest is included.
        response_keep_proof (bool): If true, proof data will be kept in every rpc response. False will remove this data after using it to verify the responses. Useful for debugging and manually verifying the proofs.
        transport_binary_format: If true, the client will communicate with the server using a binary payload instead of json.
        transport_ignore_tls: The client usually verify https tls certificates. To communicate over insecure http, turn this on.
        boot_weights (bool): if true, the first request (updating the nodelist) will also fetch the current health status and use it for blacklisting unhealthy nodes. This is used only if no nodelist is availabkle from cache.
