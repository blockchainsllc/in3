    Standard JSON-RPC calls as described in https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API.

    Whenever a request is made for a response with `verification`: `proof`, the node must provide the proof needed to validate the response result. The proof itself depends on the chain.

    For ethereum, all proofs are based on the correct block hash. That's why verification differentiates between [Verifying the blockhash](poa.html) (which depends on the user consensus) the actual result data.

    There is another reason why the BlockHash is so important. This is the only value you are able to access from within a SmartContract, because the evm supports a OpCode (`BLOCKHASH`), which allows you to read the last 256 blockhashes, which gives us the chance to verify even the blockhash onchain.

    Depending on the method, different proofs are needed, which are described in this document.

    Proofs will add a special in3-section to the response containing a `proof`- object. Each `in3`-section of the response containing proofs has a property with a proof-object with the following properties:

    *  **type** `string` (required)  - The type of the proof.   
    Must be one of the these values : `'transactionProof`', `'receiptProof`', `'blockProof`', `'accountProof`', `'callProof`', `'logProof`'
    *  **block** `string` - The serialized blockheader as hex, required in most proofs. 
    *  **finalityBlocks** `array` - The serialized following blockheaders as hex, required in case of finality asked (only relevant for PoA-chains). The server must deliver enough blockheaders to cover more then 50% of the validators. In order to verify them, they must be linkable (with the parentHash).    
    *  **transactions** `array` - The list of raw transactions of the block if needed to create a merkle trie for the transactions. 
    *  **uncles** `array` - The list of uncle-headers of the block. This will only be set if full verification is required in order to create a merkle tree for the uncles and so prove the uncle_hash.   
    *  **merkleProof** `string[]` - The serialized merkle-nodes beginning with the root-node (depending on the content to prove).
    *  **merkleProofPrev** `string[]` - The serialized merkle-nodes beginning with the root-node of the previous entry (only for full proof of receipts).   
    *  **txProof** `string[]` - The serialized merkle-nodes beginning with the root-node in order to proof the transactionIndex (only needed for transaction receipts).
    *  **logProof** [LogProof](#logproof) - The Log Proof in case of a `eth_getLogs`-request.   
    *  **accounts** `object` - A map of addresses and their AccountProof.   
    *  **txIndex** `integer` - The transactionIndex within the block (for transaactions and receipts).   
    *  **signatures** `Signature[]` - Requested signatures.

        .. graphviz::

            digraph minimal_nonplanar_graphs {
            
            fontname="Helvetica"
              subgraph all {

                node [ fontsize = "12", style="", color=black fontname="Helvetica", shape=record ]

                subgraph blockheader {
                    label="blocheader" style="" color=black

                    bheader[ label="parentHash|...|transactionRoot|<tr>receiptRoot|stateRoot"]
                    troot:a -> bheader:tr 
                }

                subgraph cluster_client_registry {
                    label="Receipt Trie"  color=lightblue  style=filled

                    troot[label="|<a>0x123456|||||"]  
                    ta[label="|0x123456||<a>0xabcdef|||"]  
                    tb[label="|0x98765||<a>0xfcab34|||"]  
                    tval[label="transaction receipt"]  

                    ta:a -> troot:a
                    tb:a -> troot:a 
                    tval:a -> ta:a
                }


              }
            }

        ```

        The proof works similiar to the transaction proof.

        In order to create the proof we need to serialize all transaction receipts 

        ```js
        transactionReceipt = rlp.encode([
          uint( r.status || r.root ),
          uint( r.cumulativeGasUsed ),
          bytes256( r.logsBloom ),
          r.logs.map(l => [
            address( l.address ),
            l.topics.map( bytes32 ),
            bytes( l.data )
          ])
        ].slice(r.status === null && r.root === null ? 1 : 0))
        ``` 

        and store them in a merkle tree with `rlp.encode(transactionIndex)` as key or path, since the blockheader only contains the `receiptRoot`, which is the root-hash of the resulting merkle tree. A merkle proof with the transactionIndex of the target transaction receipt will then be created from this tree.

        Since the merkle proof is only proving the value for the given transactionIndex, we also need to prove that the transactionIndex matches the transactionHash requested. This is done by adding another MerkleProof for the transaction itself as described in the [Transaction Proof](#eth-gettransactionbyhash).


        If the request requires proof (`verification`: `proof`) the node will provide an Transaction Proof as part of the in3-section of the response. 
        This proof section contains the following properties:

        - `type` : constant : `receiptProof`
        - `block` : the serialized blockheader of the requested transaction.
        - `signatures` : a array of signatures from the signers (if requested) of the above block.
        - `txIndex` : The TransactionIndex as used in the MerkleProof
        - `txProof` : the serialized nodes of the Transaction trie starting with the root node. This is needed in order to proof that the required transactionHash matches the receipt.
        - `merkleProof`: the serialized nodes of the Transaction Receipt trie starting with the root node.
        - `merkleProofPrev`: the serialized nodes of the previous Transaction Receipt (if txInxdex>0) trie starting with the root node. This is only needed if full-verification is requested. With a verified previous Receipt we can proof the `usedGas`.
        - `finalityBlocks`: a array of blockHeaders which were mined after the requested block. The number of blocks depends on the request-property `finality`. If this is not specified, this property will not be defined.
