    proof:
      descr: |
        The `eth_getBlockBy...` methods return the Block-Data. 
        In this case, all we need is somebody verifying the blockhash, which is done by requiring somebody who stored a deposit and would otherwise lose it, to sign this blockhash.

        The verification is then done by simply creating the blockhash and comparing this to the signed one.

        The blockhash is calculated by blockdata with [rlp](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/RLP) and hashing it:


        ```js
        blockHeader = rlp.encode([
          bytes32( parentHash ),
          bytes32( sha3Uncles ),
          address( miner || coinbase ),
          bytes32( stateRoot ),
          bytes32( transactionsRoot ),
          bytes32( receiptsRoot || receiptRoot ),
          bytes256( logsBloom ),
          uint( difficulty ),
          uint( number ),
          uint( gasLimit ),
          uint( gasUsed ),
          uint( timestamp ),
          bytes( extraData ),

          ... sealFields
            ? sealFields.map( rlp.decode )
            : [
              bytes32( b.mixHash ),
              bytes8( b.nonce )
            ]
        ])
        ```

        For POA-chains, the blockheader will use the `sealFields` (instead of mixHash and nonce) which are already RLP-encoded and should be added as raw data when using rlp.encode.

        ```js
        if (keccak256(blockHeader) !== singedBlockHash) 
          throw new Error('Invalid Block')
        ```

        In case of the `eth_getBlockTransactionCountBy...`, the proof contains the full blockHeader already serilalized plus all transactionHashes. 
        This is needed in order to verify them in a merkle tree and compare them with the `transactionRoot`.


        Requests requiring proof for blocks will return a proof of type `blockProof`. Depending on the request, the proof will contain the following properties:

        - `type` : constant : `blockProof`
        - `signatures` : a array of signatures from the signers (if requested) of the requested block.
        - `transactions`: a array of raw transactions of the block. This is only needed the last parameter of the request (includeTransactions) is `false`,  In this case the result only contains the transactionHashes, but in order to verify we need to be able to build the complete merkle-trie, where the raw transactions are needed. If the complete transactions are included the raw transactions can be build from those values.
        - `finalityBlocks`: a array of blockHeaders which were mined after the requested block. The number of blocks depends on the request-property `finality`. If this is not specified, this property will not be defined.
        - `uncles`: only if `fullProof` is requested we add  all blockheaders of the uncles to the proof in order to verify the uncleRoot.

              }
            }

        ```

        In order to prove the transaction data, each transaction of the containing block must be serialized

        ```js
        transaction = rlp.encode([
          uint( tx.nonce ),
          uint( tx.gasPrice ),
          uint( tx.gas || tx.gasLimit ),
          address( tx.to ),
          uint( tx.value ),
          bytes( tx.input || tx.data ),
          uint( tx.v ),
          uint( tx.r ),
          uint( tx.s )
        ])
        ``` 

        and stored in a merkle tree with `rlp.encode(transactionIndex)` as key or path, since the blockheader only contains the `transactionRoot`, which is the root-hash of the resulting merkle tree. A merkle-proof with the transactionIndex of the target transaction will then be created from this tree.

        If the request requires proof (`verification`: `proof`) the node will provide an Transaction Proof as part of the in3-section of the response. 
        This proof section contains the following properties:

        - `type` : constant : `transactionProof`
        - `block` : the serialized blockheader of the requested transaction.
        - `signatures` : a array of signatures from the signers (if requested) of the above block.
        - `txIndex` : The TransactionIndex as used in the MerkleProof ( not needed if the methode was `eth_getTransactionByBlock...`, since already given)
        - `merkleProof`: the serialized nodes of the Transaction trie starting with the root node.
        - `finalityBlocks`: a array of blockHeaders which were mined after the requested block. The number of blocks depends on the request-property `finality`. If this is not specified, this property will not be defined.

        While there is no proof for a non existing transaction, if the request was a  `eth_getTransactionByBlock...` the node must deliver a partial merkle-proof to verify that this node does not exist.



  eth_getLogs:
    descr: searches for events matching the given criteria. See [eth_getLogs](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#eth_getLogs) for the spec.
    proof:
      descr: |
        Since logs or events are based on the TransactionReceipts, the only way to prove them is by proving the TransactionReceipt each event belongs to.

        That's why this proof needs to provide:
        - all blockheaders where these events occured
        - all TransactionReceipts plus their MerkleProof of the logs
        - all MerkleProofs for the transactions in order to prove the transactionIndex

        The proof data structure will look like this:

        ```ts
          Proof {
            type: 'logProof',
            logProof: {
              [blockNr: string]: {  // the blockNumber in hex as key
                block : string  // serialized blockheader
                receipts: {
                  [txHash: string]: {  // the transactionHash as key
                    txIndex: number // transactionIndex within the block
                    txProof: string[] // the merkle Proof-Array for the transaction
                    proof: string[] // the merkle Proof-Array for the receipts
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        ```


        In order to create the proof, we group all events into their blocks and transactions, so we only need to provide the blockheader once per block. 
        The merkle-proofs for receipts are created as described in the [Receipt Proof](#eth-gettransactionreceipt).


        If the request requires proof (`verification`: `proof`) the node will provide an Transaction Proof as part of the in3-section of the response.

        Each of these account values are stored in the account-object:

        ```js
        account = rlp.encode([
          uint( nonce),
          uint( balance),
          bytes32( storageHash || ethUtil.KECCAK256_RLP),
          bytes32( codeHash || ethUtil.KECCAK256_NULL)
        ])
        ```

        The proof of an account is created by taking the state merkle tree and creating a MerkleProof. Since all of the above RPC-methods only provide a single value, the proof must contain all four values in order to encode them and verify the value of the MerkleProof. 

        For verification, the `stateRoot` of the blockHeader is used and `keccak(accountProof.address)` as the path or key within the merkle tree.

        ```js
        verifyMerkleProof(
        block.stateRoot, // expected merkle root
        keccak(accountProof.address), // path, which is the hashed address
        accountProof.accountProof), // array of Buffer with the merkle-proof-data
        isNotExistend(accountProof) ? null : serializeAccount(accountProof), // the expected serialized account
        )
        ```

        In case the account does not exist yet (which is the case if `none` == `startNonce` and `codeHash` == `'0xc5d2460186f7233c927e7db2dcc703c0e500b653ca82273b7bfad8045d85a470'`), the proof may end with one of these nodes:
            
        - The last node is a branch, where the child of the next step does not exist.
        - The last node is a leaf with a different relative key.

        Both would prove that this key does not exist.

        For `eth_getStorageAt`, an additional storage proof is required. This is created by using the `storageHash` of the account and creating a MerkleProof using the hash of the storage key (`keccak(key)`) as path.


        ```js
        verifyMerkleProof(
          bytes32( accountProof.storageHash ),   // the storageRoot of the account
          keccak(bytes32(s.key)),  // the path, which is the hash of the key
          s.proof.map(bytes), // array of Buffer with the merkle-proof-data
          s.value === '0x0' ? null : util.rlp.encode(s.value) // the expected value or none to proof non-existence
        ))
        ```

  eth_sendTransaction:
    descr: signs and sends a Transaction
    params:
      tx:
        descr: the transactiondata to send
        type: eth_transaction
    result:
      descr: the transactionHash
    proof:
      descr: No proof from the nodes are required, because the client can generate the TransactionHash itself. This means to ensure the success of a transaction the receipt needs to be verified.

  eth_sendTransactionAndWait:
    descr: signs and sends a Transaction, but then waits until the transaction receipt can be verified. Depending on the finality of the nodes, this may take a while, since only final blocks will be signed by the nodes.
    params:
      tx:
        descr: the transactiondata to send
        type: eth_transaction
    result:
      descr: the transactionReceipt
      type: eth_transactionReceipt

        
  eth_sendRawTransaction:
    descr: sends or broadcasts a prviously signed raw transaction. See [eth_sendRawTransaction](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#eth_sendRawTransaction)
    params:
      tx:
        descr: the raw signed transactiondata to send
        type: bytes
