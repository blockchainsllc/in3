ipfs:
  descr: |
    A Node supporting IPFS must support these 2 RPC-Methods for uploading and downloading IPFS-Content. The node itself will run a ipfs-client to handle them.

    Fetching ipfs-content can be easily verified by creating the ipfs-hash based on the received data and comparing it to the requested ipfs-hash. Since there is no chance of manipulating the data, there is also no need to put a deposit or convict a node. That's why the registry-contract allows a zero-deposit fot ipfs-nodes.

  ipfs_get:
    descr: Fetches the data for a requested ipfs-hash. If the node is not able to resolve the hash or find the data a error should be reported.
    params:
      ipfshash:
        descr:  the ipfs multi hash
        type: string
      encoding:
        descr: the encoding used for the response. ( `hex` , `base64` or `utf8`)
        type: string
    result:
      type: bytes | string
      descr: the content matching the requested hash encoded in the defined encoding.
    proof:
      descr: No proof or verification needed on the server side. All the verification are done in the client by creating the ipfs multihash and comparing to the requested hash.
    example:
      request:
        - QmSepGsypERjq71BSm4Cjq7j8tyAUnCw6ZDTeNdE8RUssD
        - utf8
      response: "I love Incubed"

  ipfs_put:
    descr: |
      Stores ipfs-content to the ipfs network.
      Important! As a client there is no garuantee that a node made this content available. ( just like `eth_sendRawTransaction` will only broadcast it). 
      Even if the node stores the content there is no gurantee it will do it forever. 
    params:
      data:
        descr:  the content encoded with the specified encoding.
        type: bytes | string
      encoding:
        descr: the encoding used for the request. ( `hex` , `base64` or `utf8`)
        type: string
    result:
      descr:  the ipfs multi hash
      type: string
    example:
      request:
        - I love Incubed
        - utf8
      response: QmSepGsypERjq71BSm4Cjq7j8tyAUnCw6ZDTeNdE8RUssD
