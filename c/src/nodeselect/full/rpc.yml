        if proof is requested, the proof will have the type `accountProof`. In the proof-section only the storage-keys of the `proofHash` will be included.
        The required storage keys are calcualted :

        - `0x00` - the length of the nodeList or total numbers of nodes.
        - `0x01` - the registryId
        - per node : ` 0x290decd9548b62a8d60345a988386fc84ba6bc95484008f6362f93160ef3e563 + index * 5 + 4`

        The blockNumber of the proof must be the latest final block (`latest`- minBlockHeight) and always greater or equal to the `lastBlockNumber` 

        #### Partial NodeLists

        if the client requests a partial nodeList and the given limit is smaller then the total amount of nodes, the server needs to pick nodes in a deterministic way. This is done by using the given seed.

        1. add all required addresses (if any) to the list.
        2. iterate over the indexes until the limit is reached:

            ```ts
            function createIndexes(total: number, limit: number, seed: Buffer): number[] {
              const result: number[] = []              // the result as a list of indexes
              let step = seed.readUIntBE(0, 6)         // first 6 bytes define the step size
              let pos  = seed.readUIntBE(6, 6) % total // next 6 bytes define the offset
              while (result.length < limit) {
                if (result.indexOf(pos) >= 0) {        // if the index is already part of the result
                  seed = keccak256(seed)               // we create a new seed by hashing the seed.
                  step = seed.readUIntBE(0, 6)         // and change the step-size
                } 
                else
                  result.push(pos)
                pos = (pos + step) % total             // use the modulo operator to calculate the next position.
              }
              return result

      In most cases these requests will come from other nodes, because the client simply adds the addresses of the requested signers 
      and the processising nodes will then aquire the signatures with this method from the other nodes.

      Since each node has a risk of signing a wrong blockhash and getting convicted and losing its deposit, 
      per default nodes will and should not sign blockHash of the last `minBlockHeight` (default: 6) blocks!

    proof:
      descr: |
        if proof is requested, the proof will have the type `accountProof`. In the proof-section only the storage-keys of the addresses and the length (`0x0`)  will be included.

        The blockNumber of the proof must be the latest final block (`latest`- minBlockHeight) and always greater or equal to the `lastBlockNumber`
