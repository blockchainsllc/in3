/** creates a new Incubes configuration for a specified chain and returns the pointer.
 * when creating the client only the one chain will be configured. (saves memory). 
 * but if you pass `CHAIN_ID_MULTICHAIN` as argument all known chains will be configured allowing you to switch between chains within the same client or configuring your own chain. 
 * 
 * you need to free this instance with `in3_free` after use!
 * 
 * Before using the client you still need to set the tramsport and optional the storage handlers:
 * 
 *  * example of initialization:
 * ```c
 * // register verifiers
 * in3_register_eth_full();
 * 
 * // create new client
 * in3_t* client = in3_for_chain(CHAIN_ID_MAINNET);
 * 
 * // configure transport
 * client->transport    = send_curl;
 *
 * // configure storage
 * in3_set_storage_handler(c, storage_get_item, storage_set_item, storage_clear, NULL);
 * 
 * // ready to use ...
 * ```
 * ** This Method is depricated. you should use `in3_for_chain` instead.**
 * 
 * @returns the incubed instance.
