# General CI rules:
#           * Create one CI.yml file per language/purpose
#           * Include said CI.yml file below
#           * We use rules in this CI, which means you cannot use only/except
#           * The workflow rules define when the CI gets triggered, job rules are used to define when jobs get triggered
#           * Do not commit any keys/ethereum addresses/private keys/etc directly, use environment variables or other methods
#           * Thank you for reading this far! Get yourself a chocolate as a treat.
